      <description>Securing Medical Images in an IoMT Ecosystem Investigated key security concerns with handling of medical images in an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) environment and proposed attack models Developed an independent and collaborated edge device-based security solution that runs parallel to the diagnostic process in IoMT ecosystem Examined the sensing layer and the network aggregation layer to understand the image data exchange mechanism in the IoMT environment Analyzed variables and protocols relevant to security and privacy in the sensing layer and the network layer to identify possible security vulnerabilities and privacy concerns Used data gathered to devise attack models that illustrate threats vectors for the combined operation of sensing layer and aggregation layer for image exchange before exposure to the open internet Proposed a 2-step edge device-based approach for image security Figure: Proposed IoMT Security Architecture Inferred raw image data received from the IoMT imaging devices and segregated it based on the type of images using a sequential deep-learning inference model with three layers Applied encryption, steganography or authentication security solutions based on inference from the image in the second step to address data fragmentation issues Conducted tests to verify the integrity and confidentiality of the image post processing.</description>
