### **RESEARCH WORK AND PROJECTS**:

**Accelerated Image Restoration using CUDA**
High Performance Computing, University of Washington

Developed and designed a performant filter to deblur images. Used C++ and CUDA to write highly parallelized versions of out-of-box OpenCV methods which proved to be 8 times more performant. Compared the accuracy of both parallel and sequential versions of the code using standard Computer Vision methodologies (PSNR and MSE Values).

**Bringing Semantics to IoT: About IoT Ontologies and their application**
Master Thesis, Cyber-Physical Systems, Technical University of Kaiserslautern

Researched how different IoT platforms can be mapped over one another, to create a singular unified compliant network of things. Developed a communication channel between Google assistant, OpenHAB and Vicinity Ontology for creating a unified IoT platform.

**Building a Map of Traffic Signs**
Augmented Vision, DFKI (German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence)

Developed software to collect geographic coordinates and images of the complete road infrastructure of a city with python. Further, developed and used hybrid hashing techniques to eliminate duplicate images and coordinates. Developed software for road sign recognition using a cascade of classical computer vision algorithms to correctly classify 77% of road signs in Luxembourg city.
